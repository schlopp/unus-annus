# unus-annus

this was my second ever project this im kinda new to the programming world, im sorry if its crap

anyways i made this as a little challenge for myself to see how much i learnt from my 'hello world' project everyone in this site has done at some 
point

this entire project is UA themed so most of the people that come across this wont understand it but for the people who do i hope you like it!
memento mori fellow unuses and annuses
